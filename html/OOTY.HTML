            <h1>OOTY</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">The Blue Mountains have always been shrouded in mysticism, and Ooty is no exception to that. For every mountain lover, the very idea of travelling to the city known as the Queen of the Hills holds an allure like no other. Once regarded as the summer headquarters of the East India Company (and for a very good reason), Ooty, also known as Udagamandalam, is a hill station in Tamil Nadu which serves as a very popular tourist destination for anyone looking for a picturesque place to relax and unwind. Ooty is nestled amidst the Nilgiri hills at an altitude of 2,240 meters above sea level and enjoys a favourable climate all year round. 
            Ooty oozes simplicity, devoid of any boundaries, so anyone who visits the             place can feel at one with the local culture. The journey to Ooty itself is dotted with magnificent sights of the awe-inspiring Nilgiri hills, tea gardens, and serene waterfalls.

          <h2>Best time to visit</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">
            The best time to visit Ooty is from October to June when the weather is pleasant and you can get involved in outdoor activities. However, it can be visited during monsoons (if you don't mind the rain) when the freshly washed surroundings give Ooty an ethereal charm. The annual Tea and Tourism Festival attracts crowds in huge numbers to visit the place and have a great time in this wonderful place.
