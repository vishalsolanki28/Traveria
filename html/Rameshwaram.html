            <h1>RAMESHWARAM</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Rameshwaram is one of the holiest places in India and is located on a beautiful island. It is separated by a small Pamban channel from Sri Lanka. According to the Hindu mythology, this is the place where Lord Rama created a bridge across the sea to Sri Lanka.
            Rameshwaram is located on a beautiful island in the lower side of India. Lord Shiva too is worshipped in this place. Renowned for its magnificent prakaras with massive sculptured pillars on either side, The Ramanathaswamy Temple houses the longest corridor in the world. Agniteertham is famous for its sacred waters and Pilgrims perform poojas in honour of their ancestors at this seashore. The Five-faced Hanuman Temple holds the floating stone which was used to build the bridge between India and Sri Lanka.

          <h2>Best time to visit</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">
            Rameshwaram experiences tropical climate which means the though the seasons greatly vary, the temperatures may not. This makes Rameshwaram a destination which can be visited all year round. However, the best time to visit is from October to April. The Monsoons (July to September) are humid with average rainfalls, but, the scenic view of the coastal region during these months is enjoyable. Winters (November to February) are cool and temperature comes down to 17 degrees Celcius. This is the most pleasant season for sightseeing and visiting neighbourhoods.
