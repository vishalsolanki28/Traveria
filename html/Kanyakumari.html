            <h1>KANYAKUMARI</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Located at the southernmost tip of the Indian peninsula, Kanyakumari is a coastal town in the state of Tamil Nadu. Earlier known as Cape Comorin, Kanyakumari is surrounded by mountains and bordered by vibrant sea shores, lined with paddy fields and coconut trees, and also boasts of aesthetic elevated patches of hills with undulating valleys and plains in between the sea and the mountainous terrain. Ever since ancient times, Kanyakumari has been one of the major centres of religion, art and culture. Famous for being the only place in India where you can observe the sunrise and sunset at the same beach, Kanyakumari is a very popular tourist destination, not just because of this unique geographical phenomenon, but also because of its pristine beaches as well as its temples and churches which attract a huge number of tourists to this city all year round.</p>

          <h2>Best time to visit</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">
            The months from October until February are considered the best time to visit Kanyakumari, as the weather remains calm and pleasant. Although this coastal region is a bit humid, this is the best time to try out some adventurous water sports, going on sightseeing and outings, undertaking beach activities and savouring the spectacular sunset views. With the beginning of winters in November, Kanyakumari also hosts many festivals during this month, for instance the Cape Festival.
