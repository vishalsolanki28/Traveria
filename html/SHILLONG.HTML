            <h1>SHILLONG</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">A beautiful city encircled by pine trees, Shillong is the capital of Meghalaya. It derives its name from Lei Shyllong, an idol worshipped at the Shillong Peak. Standing as tall as 1496 meters, Shillong provides a relief from the heat across the country. This hill station is known for its picturesque sights and traditions. The soothing climate makes Shillong suitable to visit in all seasons. The light drizzles and the cooling gentle wind adds to the joy of visiting this hill station. This place is also known as the ‘Scotland of the East’. One can find descendants of the Khyrim, Mylliem, Maharam, Mallaisohmat, Bhowal and Langrim tribes.
            Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya, is the home to numerous waterfalls. The exciting mountain peaks, crystal clear lakes, breathtakingly beautiful golf courses, museums and the zoo are the key reasons why people visit Shillong.

          <h2>Best time to visit</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">
            The best time to visit Shillong is between September and May as the weather remains pleasant during these months. It does occasionally rain, but it is relatively lesser than in the monsoons season, i.e. between June and August. During the season, the region experiences heavy rainfall, and it might be tough and inconvenient to explore the tourist attractions. The beauty in monsoons is at its peak as the terrain turns into a scenic paradise with lush greenery, lakes, ponds and waterfalls coming to life. It, therefore, can be an off-season location worth a visit for some.
