            <h1>LAKSHMAN JHULA</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">The Lakshman Jhula is a famous hanging bridge across the river Ganga that connects two villages, Tapovan in the Tehri Garhwal district and Jonk in the Pauri Garhwal district. Located 5 kilometres to the northeast of the town Rishikesh in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, the entire bridge is made up of iron, is 450 feet long and is situated at the height of 70 feet from the river. The Lakshman Jhula is extremely well known amongst tourists because of the rich mythological associations that are connected with the bridge. It is widely believed that Lord Lakshman, the younger brother of Lord Rama, had crossed the river Ganga at this same site, where the bridge now majestically stands for all to see.
            Important places around the Lakshman Jhula include the Terah Manzil temple, the Lakshman temple, and the Ram Jhula. The entire area is imbued with a mystic, serene and holy feeling to it. It is common to find people here profoundly submerged and engrossed in their religious traditions and meditations.
