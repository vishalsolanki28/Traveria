            <h1>BHEDAGHAT</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Bhedaghat is known for the Dhuandar Falls (Dhuan means smoke and Dhar means flow), a huge cascade of water that falls from a height of 98 feet. Boating in Bhedaghat especially during the moonlit night would surely make up for an unforgettable experience. The boatmen of these place are storytellers that will tell you about the place in the form of interesting stories.
            Also regarded as the Marble Rocks of Bhedaghat, this small town has earned a reputation for the massive 100 ft rocks on either side of the Narmada. Bhedaghat is in close proximity of one of the major cities of Madhya Pradesh of Jabalpur

          <h2>Best time to visit</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">
            The best time to visit Bhedaghat is from November-May. The summers are quite moderate here with temperatures reaching up to 30-34 degrees Celcius, while the winters are relatively more pleasant and colder with temperatures dropping down to 10 degrees Celcius at nights. The monsoon experiences heavy rainfalls (June 15 - October 15) and the Marble Rocks are also shut during the time, which means a trip to Bhedaghat will certainly not be a fruitful one.
