            <h1>Rural Olympics At Kila Raipur</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Home to one of the quirkiest festivals you will come around anywhere in the world - Rural Olympics, Kila Raipur is an amazing village whose love for sports and recreation is unmatched anywhere else in the country. The small village is located just 15 km from the city of Ludhiana in Punjab and is like any other village of the state with huge fields of wheat and mustard that stretch as far as eyes can see, and a certain calmness and peace about it, except for the three days of February when the village transforms into a hub of sports, enthusiasm and celebration.
            Kila Raipur is famous all over the world for its celebration of rural sports and lifestyle in its event dubbed as the Rural Olympics. Since its inception in 1933, the festival is a magnum opus of all sports festivals. The festival is a bizarre yet grand affair, where sports lovers from far and wide flock by to witness the thrill and action. The event which unfolds in three days sees all farming activities suspended and male members of the Punjabi households participating in numerous sports activities.
