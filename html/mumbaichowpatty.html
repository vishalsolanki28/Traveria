            <h1>MUMBAI CHOWPATTY</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Popularly known as Chowpatty, the beach is located in southern Mumbai along the western railway route. This small sandy beach is a popular place to chill, and a must visit for all tourists who visit Marine Drive for the first time.

            At night, the beach appears to look like a colourful fair. Children from all age groups rush to ride the Ferris wheel and merry-go-rounds, while the adults indulge in the city's famous street snacks. Visitors also head to nearby attractions and local markets, to get the most out of their day out. Never is this beach empty or deserted. You will always find one or the other person here, lazing around on the beach; or children, lost in their world, blithely building sand castles along the shore. All in all, the Girgaum Chowpatty offers fun, frenzy and delights all rolled into one, and it is worth spending a few hours here to break free from the usually claustrophobic city.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Best time to visit</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">
            You can visit Chowpatty at any time that you want to. But the crowd is considerably less during the early hours of the morning, which means that you can enjoy yourself more if you are a lover of serenity and peace. A word of caution. Avoid visiting the beach during the monsoon season, as high tides and water logging can mar your entire experience. Also, the area becomes dangerous at this point.

            If you can, plan a visit to this beach around Ganesh Chathurthi. In fact, this beach is famous and reputed for its Ganesh Visarjan celebrations. Thousands of devotees flock here from Mumbai and Pune every year to immerse the idols of Lord Ganesha in the Arabian Sea. The energy and frenzy at this time are indeed contagious and showcases the best that Mumbai has to offer. The loud chants and music playing in the background add to the liveliness of the overall atmosphere.
