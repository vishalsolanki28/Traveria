            <h1>BANKE BIHARI MANDIR</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Shri Banke Bihari Mandir is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Krishna in the holy city of Vrindavan in the Mathura district. One of the most revered shrines in the country, this temple is among the 7 temples of Thakur of Vrindavan which also include Sri Radhavallabh Ji, Shri Govind Dev Ji and four others. As you come in the presence of the Banke Bihari Temple, you are confronted with the stunning Rajasthani- style edifice of the temple, which is adorned with arched windows and meticulous stonework.
            The word 'Banke' means bent in three places, while the word 'Bihari' means supreme enjoyer.  The idol in Banke Bihari Temple was originally worshipped under the name of Kunj- Bihari which means enjoyer of lakes.
            </p>

          <h2>Best time to visit</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">
            Jhulan Yatra, the swing festival of Lord Krishna, is celebrated on the third day of the waxing moon, where Lord Banke Bihari is seated on a golden swing known as 'hindola'. The curtain is pulled shut and then opened again, every few minutes, unlike other temples. It is believed that the eyes of Banke Bihari are so brilliant at this time that it can make anyone unconscious if seen for a long time. People visit the temple in large numbers during this time, just to catch a glimpse of their revered deity.
