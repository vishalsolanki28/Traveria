            <h1>PURI</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Puri in Odisha is one of the four must-visit pilgrimage sites for Hindus because of Jagannath Temple that forms the part of Char Dham in India. Puri is a beach city located on the coast of Bay of Bengal which is one of the favourites among people of West Bengal for a short trip.
            Having gained popularity among hippies back in the 1970s due to the legalisation of Bhang, Puri is still a popular destination among backpackers, however, the availability of bhang is now limited. With a plethora of hotels and homestays, the local tourist like to stay near the New Marine Drive and the backpackers prefer to stay near Chakra Tirtha. The Rath Yatra (chariot festival) which takes place during the month of June-July should not be missed if you are planning to visit during this time.
            </p>

          <h2>Best time to visit</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">
            Having a more or less pleasant climate throughout the year, Jagannath Puri is thronged by people all year round except for peak summers (April-June). The ideal months to take a trip to Puri are between October and February when neither the scorching heat nor the high humidity is present to cause any hindrance to your outdoor plans. Winters (December-February) are a bit cold, but good to enjoy the beach and visiting temples. For those who wish to seek blessings from the Gods may visit this place during Rath Yatra, i.e between June and July.
