<h2>Best time to visit</h2>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">
    the best time to visit Tirupati is from September to February when the climate is relatively balmy with intermittent showers. The summers with its sweltering weather and humidity make Tirupati less ideal to visit. Winter months are ideal for sightseeing and also visiting the shrine, and the weather is pleasant. The town gets crowded by September which is the onset of Brahmotsavam, one of the auspicious festival of Tirupati. </p>
